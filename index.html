# Introduction to Server Sent Events

---

# What's this all about

- What is Server Sent Events (SSE)?

- Advantages/Disadvantages

- When would you use it?

- Which platforms support it?

- Working with SSE on the Server

- Working with SSE in a browser

- Working with SSE natively

- Quick demo using Spring Boot

- A robust implementation
---

# What is Server Sent Events?
- Uni-directional events Server->Client
- [W3C Specification drafted in 2009.](https://www.w3.org/TR/2009/WD-eventsource-20090423/#server-sent-events-intro)
- Part of HTML5
- [Supported by all major browsers*†‡♯](http://caniuse.com/#search=EventSource)

---
# Advantages
- Simple to implement, leverages HTTP
- Decent client support for free
- Can perform well at ~30K connected clients.
- Only does 1 thing, pushes data to clients. Again, simple.

# Disadvantages

- Doesn't work behind meddling proxies (streaming)
- Only pushes data (single direction unlike Web Sockets).
- Only works well for data easily transportable over HTTP.
- Can't perform as well as Web Sockets (HTTP overhead).
---
# When would you use it / Common use cases?
- Push updates to users for semi real time data.
- Broadcasting changes to a group of users
- Anytime you have a feature that might cause users to hit 'Refresh' for new data.

# When NOT to use it
- Mission/User critical updates
- When any guaranteed delivery is required

---
# Which platforms support it?

### Clients
- Browsers
- Any native client that supports streaming HTTP!
- Simple spec = Simple implementation
- Many OSS Clients on GitHub

### Servers
- [NodeJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sse)
- [Ruby](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionController/Live/SSE.html)
- [Spring (not great)]()
- ASP.NET ([SignalR](http://www.asp.net/signalr/overview/getting-started/introduction-to-signalr), [ServiceStack](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki/Server-Events))
- Can be implemented on virtually all HTTP server stacks.
- [~130 LoC Go implementation in a Gist](https://gist.github.com/ismasan/3fb75381cd2deb6bfa9c)!

# Working with SSE on the Server
---
### NodeJS Server usage
``` JavaScript
var SSE = require('sse')
  , http = require('http');

var server = http.createServer(function(req, res) {
  res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
  res.end('okay');
});

server.listen(8080, '127.0.0.1', function() {
  var sse = new SSE(server);
  sse.on('connection', function(client) {
    client.send('hi there!');
  });
});
```

### JavaScript client
``` JavaScript
var es = new EventSource("/sse");
es.onmessage = function (event) {
  console.log(event.data);
};
```
---
# Spring Boot
``` Java
@RequestMapping(path = "/sse", method = RequestMethod.GET)
public SseEmitter stream() throws IOException {
    SseEmitter emitter = new SseEmitter();
    emitters.add(emitter);
    emitter.onCompletion(() -> emitters.remove(emitter));
    return emitter;
}
```
### JavaScript client
``` JavaScript
var es = new EventSource("/sse");
es.onmessage = function (event) {
  console.log(event.data);
};
```
